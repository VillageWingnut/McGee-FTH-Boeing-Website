                The Free-Time Historian started as a passion project for me.
                As a large fan of all things history, I wanted to help share my passion with others that share this interest. As someone who devoted my free time to learning about history, what better way than to accept the principles of history as a free time passion project.
                So I created the Free-Time Historian - a persona, web-page, and podcast dedicated to just that, free time learning. This way I could spread knowledge and share information in short, easy to digest ways, for folks who don't have days on end to devote to learning about their passions like some others do.
                Now you can listen on the go, read at your lunch break, or just take some time to discover the past, because that is what drives this project.
