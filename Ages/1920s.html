                <p>During the 1920s, Boeing produced a series of innovative aircraft that helped establish its reputation for quality and reliability.
                Early in 1923 Boeing demonstrated its newly developed arc-welding process by equipping 3 older De Havilland DH-4s with steel fuselages.
                One of the most notable aircraft developed in this period was the Boeing Model 40, a biplane designed for airmail delivery.
                The Model 40 played a crucial role in the development of commercial aviation in the United States, providing a reliable means of transporting mail across the country.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="twosTextB">
                <p>
                    In addition to its commercial success, Boeing also made significant contributions to military aviation during this period, completing its earlier contracts from the US Navy and receiving new contracts from the US Army Air Corps.
                    The Boeing P-12, introduced in 1929, was a biplane fighter that served as the primary fighter for the United States Army Air Corps throughout the 1930s.
                    Its agility and performance made it one of the most successful fighter aircraft of its time.

                <p>
                    By the end of the 1920s, Boeing had firmly established itself as a leader in the aviation industry and was well-positioned to capitalize on the rapid growth of aviation in the decades to come.
