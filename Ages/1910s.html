                    In 1916, William E. Boeing created his first aircraft - The Boeing Model 1 - and founded the “Pacific Aero Products Co” which just a year later in 1917 would turn into the “Boeing Airplane Company”.
                    This humble company would start as just a seaplane manufacturer and with the creation of it's Boeing Model 2, or Boeing Model C, would capture the attention of the US Navy during World War I and land it's first major contract for $575,000 (almost $14 million in today's money) in 1917 for 50 Model C Aircraft for pilot training for the US Navy. This would allow for their first aircraft plant, the aptly named Boeing Plant 1, to be built in Seattle, Washington.

                    During the war, Boeing would create its first monoplane design called the Boeing XP-9 which would help lead to the creation of the P-26 Peashooter.
                    Following World War I, Boeing struggled to combat the influx of aircraft coming back from conflict and started building furniture and flat-bottomed boats to survive the lull-period in aircraft sales.
                    At the end of the decade in December of 1919, Boeing's Model 6 (or B-1 Seaplane) would make its first flight. This would go on to being their first commercial aircraft and the single built unit would carry air mail and cargo through the early and mid-20s.
