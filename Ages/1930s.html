                <p>The Great Depression had a significant impact on the aviation industry in the early 1930s, just like every other industry.
                Decreased demand for aircraft caused many companies to streamline their operations or close their doors.
                However, Boeing weathered the storm relatively well due to its diverse holdings and resources.
                In 1931, Boeing Air Transport would merge with 3 other airlines to create United Airlines (yes, THAT United Airlines) and would offer coast to coast mail and passenger service.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="threesTextB">
                <p>
                    One of Boeing's biggest achievements of the 1930s was the development of the Boeing 247, introduced in 1933. 
                    The 247 was the first modern airliner, featuring an all-metal construction, retractable landing gear, and an advanced aerodynamic design.
                    It revolutionized air travel by offering unprecedented speed, comfort, and reliability, setting new standards for commercial aviation around the world.
                </p>

            <div class="threesTextC">
                <p>
                    In 1934, Boeing introduced another groundbreaking aircraft - the B-17 Flying Fortress.
                    Designed as a long-range bomber for the United States Army Air Corps, the B-17 quickly earned a reputation for its durability and firepower, even in its early stages.
                    This aircraft will come to play a crucial role in World War II, contributing significantly to the Allied victory in Europe.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="threesTextD">
                <p>
                    Boeing also continued to innovate in the realm of commercial aviation.
                    In 1937, the Boeing Model 307 "Stratoliner", America's first pressurized commercial transport and airliner, made it's first flight. This innovative aircraft allowed passengers to fly above weather systems, offering a smoother and more comfortable travel experience. The Stratoliner would ultimately pave the way for the development of modern high-altitude jetliners.
                    In 1938, the Boeing 314 Clipper, a luxurious flying boat, was introduced to the markets.
                    The Clipper was the largest and most advanced aircraft of its time, featuring sleeping berths, dining rooms, and a colossal 3,635-mile range.

                    Despite the challenges of the Great Depression, Boeing emerged from the 1930s as one of the world's leading aerospace companies, with a reputation for excellence in both commercial and military aircraft manufacturing. 
                    The company's innovations during this period laid the foundation for its continued success in the decades to come.
